Don't forget to configure environment variables in Vercel after deployment!

## Supabase Integration

This application uses Supabase as its backend database. Key features:

- ✅ Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded credentials)
- ✅ Type-safe TypeScript interfaces for all database tables
- ✅ Reusable service layer with CRUD operations
- ✅ Full persistence for transactions, trash, and categories
- ✅ Soft-delete functionality via trash table
- ✅ Data migration tools from localStorage
- ✅ Demo page for testing database operations
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

For detailed setup instructions, see [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md).

### New in v2: Full Persistence

The following features now use Supabase for full persistence:

- **Transactions**: All transaction data is stored in Supabase and can be filtered by account
- **Trash**: Deleted items are soft-deleted to a trash table and can be restored or permanently deleted
- **Categories**: Budget categories and subcategories are stored in Supabase and can be managed via Settings

To migrate existing localStorage data to Supabase, use the Data Migration tool in Settings.

- [.env.example](.env.example) - Environment variable template

## Development vs Production

### Development
- Use `.env.local` for local configuration
- Test with Supabase Demo page at `/pages/SupabaseDemo.tsx`
- Permissive RLS policies for easier testing

### Production
- Configure environment variables in your hosting platform
- Implement strict Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Enable user authentication
- Monitor database usage and performance

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly (especially Supabase integration)

## Security Notes

- ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` or any file with credentials
- ⚠️ Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- ⚠️ Implement proper RLS policies before deploying to production
- ⚠️ Never expose your Supabase service role key in client code
